# Progress Dashboard - Structure Improvements

## 🔍 Problems with Current Design

### 1. **Information Overload**
- All sections visible at once, overwhelming users
- No clear content hierarchy
- Too many competing elements for attention

### 2. **Poor Visual Organization** 
- Heavy use of similar amber/orange gradients everywhere
- Difficult to distinguish between different content types
- No clear visual separation

### 3. **Inefficient Layout**
- Important progress charts buried in content
- Sidebar content not easily accessible
- Mobile experience likely poor with complex grids

### 4. **Navigation Issues**
- Everything on one page makes it hard to focus
- No way to quickly access specific information
- Feedback form competes with progress visualization

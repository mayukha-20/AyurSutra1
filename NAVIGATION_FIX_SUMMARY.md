# 🔧 Navigation Bug Fix - Dashboard Access Issue

## ❌ **The Problem**
Users were getting "logged out" when navigating away from their dashboards, but this wasn't actually a logout issue - it was a **missing navigation** issue!

### What Was Happening:
1. ✅ User logs in successfully (authentication working)
2. ✅ User accesses their dashboard (role protection working)  
3. ❌ User navigates to landing page (still logged in, but no way back!)
4. ❌ User couldn't find dashboard navigation buttons in navbar
5. ❌ User had to sign out and sign in again to access dashboard

## ✅ **The Root Cause**
The **Navbar component** was missing navigation buttons for practitioners and admins:

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// Only showed buttons for patients
{user.role === 'patient' && (
  <>
    <Link to="/patient/booking">Book Therapy</Link>
    <Link to="/patient/progress">Progress Dashboard</Link>
  </>
)}

// ❌ No buttons for practitioners or admins!
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// Now shows buttons for ALL roles
{user.role === 'patient' && (
  <>
    <Link to="/patient/booking">Book Therapy</Link>
    <Link to="/patient/progress">Progress Dashboard</Link>
  </>
)}

{user.role === 'practitioner' && (
  <Link to="/practitioner/dashboard">👨‍⚕️ Practitioner Dashboard</Link>
)}

{user.role === 'admin' && (
  <Link to="/admin/dashboard">⚙️ Admin Dashboard</Link>
)}
```

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**

### ✅ **Desktop Navigation**
- Added **"Practitioner Dashboard"** button for practitioners (👨‍⚕️)
